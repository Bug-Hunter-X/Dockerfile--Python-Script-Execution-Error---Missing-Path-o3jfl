This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles when executing Python scripts: failure to specify the correct path to the script. The `Dockerfile` attempts to run a Python script, but it fails due to a missing path and the lack of a working directory. The `Dockerfile-solution` provides a corrected version which fixes these issues, ensuring the script executes successfully within the Docker container.
